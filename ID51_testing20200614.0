JRX_TX Repository: 

Background:  Testing rigctl has gone very well.  I am one of the developers on
the JRX improvement team. We are making JRX blind accessible and adding the
capability to operate transmitters as well as receivers.  Controlling the HT's will
open up many doors for blind amateurs as rigs like the ID-51 have more capability
than large rigs a few years ago, but the voice feedback is not sufficient to operate
all those features.  We are developing on the Mac first because it has a large
following in the blind community because of the support for VoiceOver.   We are
expecting a Beta release of JRX_TX in September 2020.  I have access to these rigs
through our development group:
IC-7100
ID-1
IC-706
TH-74A
TH-71A
TH-7A
ID-51A      
Will report on each as time allows, but I will spend most of my time with the
IC=7100 and the ID-51A while I develop and test the JRX_TX application.  FYI, 
making VoiceOver play nicely on a Mac takes about the same effort as developing
the app for sighted use.  It's not for the feint of heart.  I am retired now and
this keeps me off the street. 73 Coz
